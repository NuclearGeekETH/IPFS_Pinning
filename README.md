# IPFS_Pinning
 Pin a file to IPFS using Pinata or Web3.storage and python

You will need api keys from either [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) or [Web3.storage](https://web3.storage/). Add your keys to a .env file in your root directory. 

Install missing dependecies with pip and run pin_file.py to pin a single file or pin_directory.py to pin a directory. pin_directory only works with Web3.storage for now. Working on improving this.
